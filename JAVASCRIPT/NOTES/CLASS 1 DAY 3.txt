                                                              CLASS 1 DAY 3






2 types - variables (unfixed) and literals (constant)


/////SOME RULES TO DECLA RE NAME  OF VARIABLES
-case sensitive
-begin with lwtter _ or $ and can consist of same 
-cannot be a reserved keyworf


/////DECLARING A VARIABLE 
	var age ;
let name ;
OR
let a=4,b=44;


////CONSTANT 

- we always have to assign a value to a  const or else there will be an error (missing initializer)
- constant value cannot be changed/reassigned 
- const value cannot be redeclared


/////COMMENTS

used to understrnaf the code better 
single line and multiline 
// and /* kncl;wddmcclwmc*/


///DATA TYPES 

number 
string 
null
undefined
Boolean


====== Number --- let a=2 , let wef=3221;
====== infinity ----- let a=5/0--(infinity)              let b= -3/0--(-infinity)
====== we can use notation  e to represent the numbers that are very long ------ let num = 5e9;(5000000000)   let num2= 5e-5;(0.00005)


///OPERATIOMN 
let ef=3,b=4235;
let c=ef+b;


======String
string can be  defined n three ways 
"jbfowe"
'khfiownf'
and even `wefn`(backstick)


===Concatanation when 2 or more strings or numbers with strings are added in a single console with+



=====Boolean 

boolan contains 2 values either true or false 
let dd= true;
let krrn= false;
do not use inverted commas or it wikll be a string 


Boolean function -- Boolean()

result = 671;
console.log(Boolean(result));-- true 
it will show true for evert input 
and false will be the resulf of Boolean(0) or an empty string or undefined null and NaN in the Booleanfunction



===== Null
null represents no value or nothing null is defined as null
let a= null;





======Undefined  
when a variable is declared but not assigned with any value the output will automatically be undefined 
let s; console.log(s);-----undefined 




only for same type of strings i.e nmvberic stribg we can substract
if the strings are in any other format it will nor display anything

we can use * and / too with numeric strings
