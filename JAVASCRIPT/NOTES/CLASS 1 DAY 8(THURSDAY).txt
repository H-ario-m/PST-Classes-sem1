                             CLASS 1 DAY 8(THURSDAY)




CONTROL STATEMENT 

JS CONTROL STATEMENT IS USED TO CONTROL THE EXECUTION OF PROGRAM BASED ON SPECIFIC CONDITION.



IF STATEMENT 
IF ELSE STATEMENT
SWITCH STATEMENT


IF STAMENT ====  EXECUTES CODE BASED ON SOME SPECIFIC STATEMENT 
     if (condition){


// enters only if the condition is true if not it exits the code 

}




ELSE SYATEMENT ===  IF THE IF CONDITIONN EXECUTES FALSE WE CALL IT TO ELSE THAN ELSE STATEMNT IS USED 


       else
{
// no condition is added to else and if the if statement gets executed the code wil skip the if part 

}




ELSE IF STATEMENT ==== WE CAN NOW USE MULTIPLE CONDITIONS IN IF ELSE USING ELASE IF IF THE IF IS FFALSE IT WILL GO TO THE ELSE IF THEN AGAIN THE NEXT ELSE IF THEN FINALLY TO ELSE


  else if ("condition")
{


}




                                   NESTED IF ELSE STAMENT 

IF FIRST CONDITION IS TRUE IT WILL COME INSIDE THE BLOCK OF THE STATEMENT AND WILL CHECK THE CONDITIONS THERE 
IF THE FIRST IS NOT TRUE IT WILL DIRECTLY MOVE TO THE NEXT CONDITION AND THEN AGAIN IF ITS TRUE IT WILL GO INSIDE THE BLOCK AND CHECK THE CONDITIONS THERE




if (){
       if(){
            }
        else{
            }
}

 







                                                           SWITCH CASE(switch can reduce the time complexity of the code)




CASE STATEMENT EXECUTES DIFFERENT BLOCKS OF CODE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE GIVEN EXPRESSION 




switch ("expression"){


case 1 : 

// when the first code is true the code will stop executing after it and directly move outsode the block;
breAK;

case 2: 
//if the above is not true it will move tp yhe n ext 

break;

default :
// if the conditions are not true it moves to default and anythiomg inside the block is executed and default doesmt have a break statement


                                       
                                                   GAURAV SIR 


                           IF ELSE WE CAN ADD BOTH BOOLEAN AND CONDITION AND THE BLOCK WILL BE EXECUTED 


CASE CAN ONLY HAVE A PATTERN VALUE BECAUSE SWITCH IS TAKING BOOLEAN ALSO AS A PATTERN 






                                       CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS -----------> CONDITIONAL AND LOOPS
