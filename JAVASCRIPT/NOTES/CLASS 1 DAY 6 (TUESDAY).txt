CLASS 1 DAY 6 (TUESDAY)


                                FUNCTIONS


Function is a reusable block of code which ise used to perform some specific task 
define it once and call it multiple times 
--organized code 
--reusability
--readability

function name(parameter1,parameter2,parameter3...........)
{
//body of the function 
}
          
                                CONTROL FLOW

                                      RETURN STATEMENT

we cam use return keyword to return anything from the code 
nothung will run after trhe retrun statement 

anything return in a function after the retrun statement will not be executed 

function greet(){
console.log("hello")
return "his name is chigota";
console.log("djfb");
}


output will not bave the last console because it is after the return statement




                                        JAYA SIR 


function add(n1,n2)
{console.log("addition");
let result=n1+n2;
}

console.log(add(27+53))     ==============   output -- addition









function add(n1,n2)
{console.log("addition");
let result=n1+n2;
return result
}

console.log("result",add(27+53))    =================  output -- addition    result 15

here "result" is printed between additiona and 15 due to a feature called call stack 



due to the call stack feature we can also call a function before even defining the function 





`` backtics are used insted of "" because backtics print everything from a line to a paragraph and camn prioiont in different lines too
also we can use ${} to insert values inside the strings
